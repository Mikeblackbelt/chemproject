      <h2>What is the optimal acidity for my soil?</h2>
      <p>
        The optimum pH for a plant varies with every plant type. Having the right pH for a plant is necessary in order for the plant to properly absorb all the nutrients that a plant needs, and less of the ones they don’t. For example, a lower pH would allow for an increase in the solubility of plant nutrients like copper, iron, and zinc. On the other hand, for most plants, anything below a pH of 5.5, would have a toxic concentration of the same minerals, leading to plant decay. For your specific plant, you would have to adjust the conditions to suit it best, with it being a pH of 5, or of 9, you have to make the soil work for you.

      <h2>How do I adjust pH?</h2>
      <p>
        Adjusting soil pH can be done in a variety of ways. There are different reasons for why you can choose to pick between lime, or fertilizers, or other chemicals. We choose the easiest to use. While an increase in the pH of the soil can have other adverse effects on the soil, our product fixes that problem. Our product allows for immediate addition to the soil, without the disturbance of soil structure or nutrition. This does not mean that you cannot over use this product, but it makes the use of it safer.

      <p>
        It is important to remember that every soil type is different, and needs different conditions for growing. At the moment, we do not have any good guides to help with this, so it recommended that you do your own research on your own for further assurance.

      <h2>What about fertilizers?</h2>
      <p>
        While we do not specialize in this area, we can provide you with some assistance toward the subject of fertilizing your soil. First, the selected fertilizer has to not conflict with your type of soil, otherwise it can actually hurt the growth of your plants. The basic components of a fertilizer are Nitrogen, Potassium, and Phosphorus. Some fertilizers contain different percentages of each of the listed nutrients based on the grade of the selected fertilizer. It is important to choose the correct type of fertilizer for you, because too strong of a fertilizer can result in damage being done to the plants’ growth.
        Fertilizer is also not a solution to any problems surrounding plant growth, as the problems could be caused by a variety of factors not related to plant nutrition.

    <h2>What is the issue?</h2>
    <p>Fertile soil has a pH range of roughly 5.5 - 6.5, with acidic soil being considered having a pH of less than 5. </p>
    <p>This lowering of pH can be caused by several factors, but result in dire consequences for the stability of the soil. These include:</p>
    <ul class="issue-list">
        <li> Decreased Nutrient Absorption, affecting: </li>
            <div class="nutrient-list">
                <li><p>Nitrogen</p></li>
                <li><p>Potassium</p></li>
                <li><p>Phosphorus</p></li>
            </div>
        <li>Increased likelihood of toxic metals dissolving in the soil (bad!) </li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2>Why limestone?</h2>
    <p>Limestone isn't a magical rock, it contains Calcium Carbonate. 
    Calcium Carbonate, a chemical compound with formula CaCO<sub>3</sub>, interacts with acids to release Carbonic Acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which disintergates into Carbon Dioxide and Water, as shown in the below equation:</p>
    <p>CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2H<sup>+</sup>(aq) -> Ca<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l)</p>
    <p>This in turn, as well as a result of the basicness of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, neutralizes acidic soil.</p>

    <h2>Why OUR Limestone?</h2>

    <p>We add nutrients, helping your plants stay alive!</p>
    <p>We also make it bigger chunks, so it disperes gradually and lasts longer.</p>

    <h1>What is the issue?</h1>
    <p>Fertile soil has a pH range of roughly 5.5 - 6.5, with acidic soil being considered having a pH of less than 5. </p>
    <p>This lowering of pH can be caused by several factors, but result in dire consequences for the stability of the soil. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decreased Nutrient Absorption, affecting </li>
        <pre><li>Nitrogen</li>
             <li>Potassium</li>
             <li>Phosporous</li></pre>
        <li>Increased likelihood of toxic metal dissolving in the soil (bad!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Why limestone?</h1>
    <p>Limestone isn't a magical rock, it contains Calcium Carbonate</p>
    <p>Calcium Carbonate, a chemical compound with formula CaCO<sub>3</sub>, interacts with acids to release Carbonic Acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which disintergates into Carbon Dioxide and Water, as shown in the below equation:</p>
    <p>CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2H<super>+</super>(aq) -> Ca<super>2+</super>(aq) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l)</p>
    <p>This in turn, as well as a result of the basicness of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, neutralizes acidic soil.</p>

    <h1>Why OUR Limestone?</h1>

    <p>We add nutrients, helping your plants stay alive!</p>
    <p>We also make it bigger chunks, so it disperes gradually and lasts longer.</p>
